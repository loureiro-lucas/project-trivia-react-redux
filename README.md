# Project Trybe Trivia ðŸš€

This is the second project of the Trybe course developed as a team. It's a trivia game that gets the questions from Open Trivia Database API, and the avatar picture from Gravatar API.

The app has some settings for the questions, marks the score and builds a ranking that is saved in the `localstorage`.

That was a great opportunity to practice my soft skills, as well the hard skills (specially `React`). The project was developed in a transition period for `hooks`, hence the mix between `classes` and `functions`.

We decided to style our projects individually, so the style was fully developed by me, a great opportunity to learn how to use the `Material UI`.

**The app's interface is in Brazilian Portuguese as a mandatory project requirement, however the questions and filters are in English, as they come from the API.**

`Requirements`

User must be able to complete the game and be able to see their score after answering all 5 questions, in addition to accessing the settings and ranking screen.
